# Binary-Search-Tree-from-file

Description:This project is to create a binary search tree class called BinTree along with some additional functions (remove function is not required).  Your code should be able to read a data file consisting of many lines (an example file called data2.txt will be given containing lines as shown below) to build binary search trees.
